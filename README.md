  <h1 style="color: lightblue;">DSA and Revision</h1>
  <p>This repository is where Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) meet late-night debugging sessions. Primarily written in <b>Java</b>, with occasional <b>Python</b> scripts for when coffee runs out, and <b>C</b> programs for when you're feeling brave.</p>

## DSA
- **[Java Programs](Java/DSA)**  
  Java: because debugging is easier when your language sounds like coffee.  

- **[Python Programs](Python/DSA)**  
  Python solutions for DSA: clean, concise, and perfect for when you need your code to "just work."

## Revision
- **[Python Programs](Python/Misc/)**  
  A collection of Python scripts â€” because sometimes you just need to duct tape a solution together and call it a day.

- **[C Programs](C/Misc/)**  
  C programs for brushing up on algorithms and reminding yourself why null pointers are the true boss fights of programming.
